The Hewlett Foundation sees a need for field-building because until now, Brazil’s posture toward nuclear technology has been determined by specific interests rather than receiving a full airing of its merits and implications. To establish a framework for meaningful discourse, the projects are building understanding between experts and policymakers in Brazil and the international community about Brazil’s nuclear policy, what Brazilian leaders envision for their nuclear energy program, and how they plan to engage in global nonproliferation efforts. We have worked with project leaders from both organizations to transition the projects to other funders inside and outside Brazil after the Hewlett Foundation exits the field.

The Hewlett Foundation was an original member of the consortium of donors that conceived and created the Nuclear Innovation Collaborative—based on a shared assessment that significant revitalization of the nuclear security field is needed to achieve progress on these issues. With the project now going into operation, the grantee can use this grant to start functioning as a source of nuclear security venture capital, bringing new ideas and new actors into the nuclear security field.

The Hewlett Foundation sees a need for field-building because until now, Brazil’s posture toward nuclear technology has been determined by specific interests rather than receiving a full airing of its merits and implications. To establish a framework for meaningful discourse, the projects are building understanding between experts and policymakers in Brazil and the international community about Brazil’s nuclear policy, what Brazilian leaders envision for their nuclear energy program, and how they plan to engage in global nonproliferation efforts. We have worked with project leaders from both organizations to transition the projects to other funders inside and outside Brazil after the Hewlett Foundation exits the field.

There are 2 million people living in this two-county region—more than 45 percent are people of color, one-third of residents are immigrants, nearly half the workforce is foreign-born, and close to two-thirds of those under the age of eighteen are children of immigrants. The community foundation led successful capacity-building efforts for organizations serving low-income people and communities of color, including multiyear general support paired with technical assistance. Using its experience and cultural competency, the foundation will continue to focus on organizations working to improve the quality of life for marginalized communities.
