The issue that started this repo is: https://github.com/vipulnaik/donations/issues/7

For the data source, see https://www.hewlett.org/grants/

Scripts:

- `scrape.py`: scrapes grants info and puts it in `data.csv`.
- `proc.py`: uses `data.csv` to print a SQL insert file that can be used with
  the donations list website.
